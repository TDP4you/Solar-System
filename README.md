# Solar System (C++, OpenGL)
  
I have implemented System System using C++ and OpenGL in Visual Studion 2017. Various planets objects are rendered on the screen. Other Features are Camera Movement and Planet Rotation. 

Note: This is a Visual Studio project and can be run directly from the .sln file but you have to add include and libraries folder properly with your project.
